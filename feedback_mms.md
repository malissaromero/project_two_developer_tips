# Feedback from Matt (mms)

## Overview

Looks good overall.  It was fun to read your progression in the readme.  Good job keeping your scope achievable.  Code is organized and formatted well.  Items have a single responsibility.  You progressed smoothly, got your MVP working early, and took the time to review, improve, and even struggle with some tough concepts.  Excellent!

## Project Workflow: How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?

Exceeds Expectations.  Nice readme.  Thanks for sharing.  Your commits show a good progression and comments are clear and helpful.  I couldn't find your user stories, but was glad to hear they were helping you prioritize.


## Technical Requirements: How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?

Exceeds Expectations.  You met the basics, then proceeded on to `has_many :through`.  Impressive.

## Creativity / Interface: How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?

Meets Expectations for Project 2.  It could use some visual separation.  Each item blends with the next.

## Code Quality: How able would an uninformed programmer be to reuse and extend your code?

Meets Expectations: Code is organized and formatted well.  Items have a single responsibility.  You are following Rails conventions.  Good job cleaning up after transitioning to Categorizations.


## Deployment and Functionality: How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?

Meets Expectations: Deployed.  The sign up flow was a little confusing.  After I signed up,  I was taken back to the sign up page, but told that I needed to sign in.  After signing in, I was returned to the sign in page again.  You can control this flow within the controller.

## Conclusion

Your average is a solid 2.4, pushing above meets expectations.  Nice work.  Your progress is looking really good.
